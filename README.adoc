*Sample Business Application for Spring Boot*

For reproducing the issue with *@SequenceGenerator* and *allocatedSize*.

* Clone this workspce
* Create a postgres database instance and create the role 'jbpm', with a password 'jbpm':
** psql>  CREATE USER jpbm SUPERUSER LOGIN PASSWORD jpbm
* Create a database in this instance named 'jbpm':
** psql> CREATE DATABASE jbpm

* If using openshift, port forward from the localhost:5432 to <pod_name>:5432:
** oc port-forward <pod_name> 5432:5432
* Alternatively, if you need to change the postgres URL, amend the ./business-application-service/src/main/application-postgres.properties file:
** spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/jbpm

* Delpoy the jpbm-schema.sql to the jpbm database
** psql postgres://jbpm:jbpm@localhost:5432/jbpm -a -f ./ddl-scripts/postgresql-jbpm-schema.sql
* if you changed the postgres URL make sure to refelect it here

* The database schema should now deploy successfully:
* Check the database schema
** psql> connect jpbm
** psql> \dt
** This should list all of the database tables for Process Automation Manager

* Start the application:
** cd business-application-service
** ./launch.sh clean install -Ppostgres

* You should recieve the following error:

** *Caused by: org.hibernate.MappingException: The increment size of the [TASK_DEF_ID_SEQ] sequence is set to [50] in the entity mapping while the associated database sequence increment size is [1].*

* This is due to the allocationSize in the PAM code defaulting to a size of '50' and the Postgres INCREMENT BY defaulting to 1. To check this is the case, amend the TASK_DEF_ID_SEQ sequence to 50:

** psql> ALTER SEQUENCE TASK_DEF_ID_SEQ INCREMENT BY 50
** ./launch.sh clean install -Ppostgres

* You should recieve the following error:

** *Caused by: org.hibernate.MappingException: The increment size of the [CORRELATION_KEY_ID_SEQ] sequence is set to [50] in the entity mapping while the associated database sequence increment size is [1].*

* The following sequences would need to be amended:
** bam_task_id_seq
** case_id_info_id_seq
** context_mapping_info_id_seq
** correlation_key_id_seq
** correlation_prop_id_seq
** error_info_id_seq
** process_instance_info_id_seq
** request_info_id_seq
** sessioninfo_id_seq
** task_def_id_seq
** task_event_id_seq
** workiteminfo_id_seq
